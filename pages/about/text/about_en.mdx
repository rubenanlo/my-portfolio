Hi there! I'm <span style={{color:"#F3B177"}}>Ruben Andino</span>, an economist turned full-stack web developer after
over 10 years of analysing data in international tax, particularly in [transfer
pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_pricing), and automatising pretty much any process I could. Passionate about <span style={{color:"#F3B177"}}>developing intuitive data models and software tools
to minimise human errors</span>, after a big international move, I decided to finally
switch gears and start a career as a MERN web developer.

From a previous successful career in consulting, I learned how to understand any business
and how to <span style={{color:"#F3B177"}}>translate complex ideas into simple and intuitive interfaces</span>. This
reflects on all web applications that I develop, which aim at creating intuitive
user interfaces, ensuring that target, often non-technical, users can easily
understand their functionality and find the information they need in the wink of
an eye. Here you have an [example](https://deploy-preview-8--mitigation-toolkit.netlify.app/) - <i>please select China
for full functionality</i>.

Avid for learning, I also love developing applications to <span style={{color:"#F3B177"}}>improve processes already in place</span>. One example is a new backend testing methodology that I
developed, which allows for comprehensive testing of entire datasets rather than
just spot checking. This methodology led to over 3,500 JEST tests executed in
under 3 seconds. Click [here](https://github.com/rubenanlo/JEST-testing-utils)
for the code.

With a goal to minimise the probablity of human error and to ease update and
reusability, I like to follow and develop best practices and my approach to code
is component oriented, producing small components that can be easily adapted and reused.
In fact, I have <span style={{color:"#F3B177"}}>developed best practices</span> in the past when they did not exist. As
a transfer pricing economist, I led a team of experts in designing best
practices for building automated data models, which was later
implemented across the US Northeast region within a Big4 transfer pricing
practice.

Throughout my career, I've managed several large-scale projects and acted as a <span style={{color:"#F3B177"}}>mentored</span>
teams at Big4 companies. <span style={{color:"#F3B177"}}>Effective communication</span> has been crucial in my project
management approach, contributing significantly to the success of every project
I've handled.
